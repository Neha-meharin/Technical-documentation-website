    <header>Introduction</header>
    <p>Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet (“the cloud”). This model provides scalable and flexible IT resources, enabling users to access and manage them as needed, often with pay-as-you-go pricing.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Core_Components_of_Cloud_Computing">
    <header>Core Components of Cloud Computing</header>
    <p>Following are core components</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Compute:</b> The processing power required to run applications and services. This includes virtual machines (VMs), containers, and serverless computing.</li>
        <li><b>Storage:</b> Persistent data storage solutions such as object storage, block storage, and file storage. Cloud storage is typically scalable and redundant.</li>
        <li><b>Networking:</b> Virtual networks, load balancers, and other networking services that ensure the secure and efficient transfer of data across the cloud infrastructure.</li>
        <li><b>Databases:</b> Managed database services that offer relational, NoSQL, and in-memory databases, optimized for scalability and performance.</li>
      </ul>
    
  </section>

<!--------------------------- -->
  
  <section class="main-section" id="Service_Models">
    <header>Service Models</header>
    <p>Cloud computing is typically categorized into three primary service models:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</b> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networks, giving them control over the operating systems, applications, and network configurations. Example: Amazon EC2.</li>
        <li><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</b> Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. Example: Google App Engine.</li>
        <li><b>Software as a Service (SaaS):</b> Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. The service provider manages the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. Example: Microsoft Office 365..</li>
       
      </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Deployment_Models">
    <header>Deployment Models</header>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Public Cloud:</b> Services are delivered over the public internet and shared among multiple organizations. This model offers scalability and cost efficiency. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</li>
        <li><b>Private Cloud:</b> Cloud infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization, providing more control over data, security, and compliance. The private cloud can be managed internally or by a third party..</li>
        <li><b>Hybrid Cloud:</b> Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model offers greater flexibility and optimization of existing infrastructure, security, and compliance requirements.</li>
       
      </ul>

        <li><b>Virtualization:</b> A core technology that enables the creation of virtual machines (VMs) that can run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical server.</li>
        <li><bContainers:</b> A lightweight virtualization method that packages applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistent environments across different computing environments.</li>
        <li><b>Serverless Computing:</b> A model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources, allowing developers to focus on code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.</li>

  <section class="main-section" id="Security_and_Compliance">
    <header>Security and Compliance</header>
    <p>Security in cloud computing is multi-faceted and involves several layers of protection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</b> Controls who can access cloud resources and what actions they can perform.</li>
        <li><b>Encryption:</b> Data at rest and in transit should be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access..</li>
        <li><b>Compliance:</b> Cloud providers offer compliance certifications (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) to meet industry-specific regulatory requirements.</li>
       
      </ul>

    <header> Benefits of Cloud Computing</header>
    
      <ul>
        <li><b>Cost Efficiency:</b> Reduces the capital expense of buying hardware and software, as well as setting up and running on-site data centers.</li>
        <li><b>Scalability:</b> Easily scale resources up or down as needed, offering flexibility to handle variable workloads.</li>
        <li><b>Performance:</b> Offers high-performance resources, often with global network capabilities to deliver low-latency services.</li>
        <li><b>Reliability:</b> Provides data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity services to ensure availability and resilience.</li>

  <section class="main-section" id="Challenges_and_Considerations">
    <header>Challenges and Considerations</header>
     <p><ul>
        <li><b>Security Concerns:</b> While cloud providers offer robust security measures, organizations must still address data protection, privacy, and regulatory compliance.</li>
        <li><b>Downtime Risks:</b> Cloud services may experience outages, affecting business operations. It's crucial to have a backup and recovery plan.</li>
        <li><b>Vendor Lock-In:</b> Moving services between different cloud providers can be challenging due to differences in platforms, APIs, and service models.</li>

<section class="main-section" id="Code_in_Cloud_Computing">
    <header>Code in Cloud Computing</header>
    <p>In cloud computing, code refers to the scripts, programs, or applications that are developed and executed in the cloud environment. Cloud computing platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide a range of services that allow you to write, deploy, and manage code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

Here’s an overview of how code is used in different cloud computing contexts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):</b>
 Infrastructure as Code is a practice where infrastructure is managed and provisioned using code instead of manual processes. It allows you to automate the setup of servers, networks, and other infrastructure components.
</li>
<code>provider "aws" 
  {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}
</code>
        <li><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</b>
Definition: PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure..</li>
<code>from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
</code>
        <li><b>Function as a Service (FaaS):</b>
 FaaS, or serverless computing, allows you to run individual functions in the cloud without provisioning or managing servers. You write the function code, and the cloud provider handles the rest.</li>
 <code>def lambda_handler(event, context):
    message = 'Hello, {}!'.format(event['name'])
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': message
    }
</code>
        <li><b>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):</b>
Definition: CI/CD pipelines automate the testing, building, and deployment of code, allowing for rapid and reliable releases.</li>
<code>name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test

  </code>
  <li><b>Microservices and Containers:
Definition:</b> Microservices architecture involves breaking down applications into small, loosely coupled services. Containers are used to package these microservices..</li>
<code>name: FROM node:14

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]


  </code>
      </ul>
